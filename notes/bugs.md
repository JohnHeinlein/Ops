### Cloning
1) Cloned assets do not display any history
   - May not be a problem, since clones should always have a suffix

2) Administrative clones do not contribute to metrics
   - Have not verified in quite some time, since I don't want to manipulate my own metrics

### Searching
1) Deselecting items is unreliable
2) General search page (`/View/Search`) does not have a column picker, despite being made for assets
   - This page is extremely useful in general though, since it lets me embed links to on eBay and SellerCloud to specific SKUs

### Item Specifics
1) Does not show categoryId nor categoryName
2) Every single option determines the SKU
   - Excessive, we could restrict it to just the required & recommended aspects
3) Does not label which specifics are required nor recommended
